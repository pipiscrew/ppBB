# ppBB

A lightweight PHP forum system using PDO sqlite. Inspired by [Xeoncross/forumfive](https://github.com/Xeoncross/forumfive) sadly the persona website doesnt exist anymore. Here is a compact forum version, supports only one user :)

* 4 database tables
* 12 PHP files
* 30kb

Database file and structure if doesnt exist will be created on first sign in, see the login.php code.
