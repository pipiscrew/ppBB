# ppBB

A lightweight PHP forum system using PDO sqlite. Inspired by [Xeoncross/forumfive](https://github.com/Xeoncross/forumfive) sadly the persona website doesnt exist anymore. Here is a compact forum version, supports only one user :)

* 12 PHP files
* 30kb

This project uses the following 3rd-party dependencies :
* [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [summernote](https://github.com/summernote/summernote/) with [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
